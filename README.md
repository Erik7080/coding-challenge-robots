Coding challenge - Erik

The structure of the code is divided in a view.html page that displays a textarea to insert the input and a readonly text area to display the output.

The logic is located in a separated logic.js file linked to the view, same for the style.css. 

Tests can be run by running the command "yarn test" in the terminal.
